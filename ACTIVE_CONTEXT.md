# ACTIVE CONTEXT

*Live operational state. Updated at every session end.*

---

## Current Phase

**Three parallel tracks:**

1. **Engine — data integrity layer.** This session shipped persistence (`_signal_history` survives restarts), per-evaluator API filtering, dispatch-time pre-TP stamping, broker-side close on every non-TP exit, DCA Entry-2 execution, KZ uniformity, and self-healing invalidation-status reconciliation. Auto-trade is now a B12-correct system end-to-end: paper or live mode keeps the broker in lockstep with engine state, no stranded positions on thesis kills.

2. **Lumin app — data-honest UX.** v0.0.7 ships live data, v0.0.8 adds cosmetic + UX honesty fixes, v0.0.9 adds per-agent drill-down + closed-status sub-filters + format-helper foundation. The app now renders historical signals, real per-evaluator stats, and status-diverse closes correctly.

3. **Held — paid-volume drought / SR_FLIP investigation.** Truth report still shows the underlying business problem (engine producing very few paid-tier signals; SR_FLIP firing all watchlist; OI-gate dominating soft-penalty bottleneck post-KZ-disable). Held per owner direction earlier this session — visible in the backfilled history now (mostly small-pct closes, no TP hits in the latest set).

---

## What's Currently Working

### Engine
- **Engine** healthy, scanning 75 pairs continuously, deploying via GitHub Actions
- **Monitor** runtime truth report on `monitor-logs` branch — regime distribution, gate metrics, confidence component breakdown, soft-penalty per-type breakdown, scoring-engine-dimension breakdown, pre-TP fire stats, free-channel post attribution, invalidation quality audit
- **Risk-component scoring** calibrated for scalp R-multiples (max credit at 2.0R)
- **Regime classifier** BB-width VOLATILE threshold at 8.0% (env-overridable)
- **HTF mismatch policy** soft penalty (not hard block) on SR_FLIP / QCB / FAR
- **QUIET-block doctrine** uniform 65 paid-tier floor — no scrap-routing exempts
- **Universal 0.80% SL floor** plus per-setup caps active
- **Invalidation quality audit** classifying every kill as PROTECTIVE / PREMATURE / NEUTRAL post-30-min
- **Counter-trend Regime-neutral baseline** (LSR / FAR) — `_REGIME_NEUTRAL_SETUPS` frozenset gives 14.0 baseline in non-affinity regimes (avoids HTF-soft-penalty + Regime-score double penalty)
- **Kill Zone disabled on all 8 SCALP-family channels** (`360_SCALP` + 7 auxiliaries) — PR #303. Reversible per channel via `_CHANNEL_GATE_PROFILE` in `src/scanner/__init__.py:435-444`
- **Pre-TP grab Phase A** live in production (`PRE_TP_ENABLED=true`). Threshold + trigger price now stamped at dispatch (B11) — Telegram post shows the actual trigger price instead of the static floor; auto-trade fires deterministically against the locked target rather than a moving ATR-recompute. PR #301
- **Auto-trade Phase A1+A2+A3 complete:** PaperOrderManager (15 tests), RiskManager 6 gates (23 tests), PositionReconciler (21 tests). Live `OrderManager` is real CCXT-backed (not stubbed). All env-overridable. `/automode` Telegram command for runtime mode flips without redeploy
- **Auto-trade non-TP close + DCA execution** (PR #302): every SL_HIT / INVALIDATED / EXPIRED / CANCELLED path now closes the broker in lockstep with engine state via `order_manager.close_full(reason=…)`. DCA Entry-2 reaches the broker via `order_manager.add_dca_entry(signal)` — additional qty = `existing × (weight_2/weight_1)` so weighted-avg-entry at the broker matches engine's avg_entry. Risk-gate-checked at DCA time
- **`_signal_history` persistence** (PR #299) — `data/signal_history.json`, atomic flush on terminal-state archive, capped at 500 entries; survives engine restarts. Plus first-boot **backfill** from `signal_performance.json` + `invalidation_records.json` (PR #304) and **self-healing reconciliation** (PR #305) that runs every boot to repair INVALIDATED status against the audit log
- **Macro watchdog Phase 1+2a+2b+5:** HIGH/CRITICAL events to free channel, BTC big-move alerts, BTC/ETH 1h regime-shift alert, paid signal-close storytelling mirror

### Subsystems present in code
- **DynamicTierManager** (`src/tier_manager.py` + `DYNAMIC_TIER_*` env vars) — dynamic pair-tier promotion based on liquidity / volume
- **ContentScheduler** (`src/scheduler.py`) — daily briefings, weekly scoreboard, performance reports to free channel
- **TradeObserver** — captures full trade lifecycle for AI-digest content
- **FreeWatchService + RadarAlert** — watch creation via `_handle_radar_candidate`; resolved on paid signal

### API + Lumin app
- **VPS API live** at `https://api.luminapp.org` — nginx reverse-proxy, Let's Encrypt cert, rate-limited 60 r/min
- **API endpoints (11 total):** `/api/health`, `/api/auth/anonymous`, `/api/auth/refresh`, `/api/pulse`, `/api/signals` (with optional `?status=&setup_class=`), `/api/signals/{id}`, `/api/positions`, `/api/activity` (with optional `?setup_class=`), `/api/auto-mode` GET/POST, `/api/agents` (per-evaluator stats with telemetry counters + 24h lifecycle counters: closed_today / tp_hits / sl_hits / invalidated / last_signal_age_minutes). `SignalDetail` carries `pre_tp_threshold_pct` + `pre_tp_trigger_price` for the app to display
- **Anonymous-JWT auth** on every protected endpoint; static-bearer escape hatch for owner debug behind `API_ALLOW_STATIC_TOKEN`. Pure-stdlib HS256 (no PyJWT dep)
- **Lumin v0.0.9 shipped:** Pulse / Signals / Trade pages on real engine data; per-agent drill-down (bottom sheet with stats card + 10 most-recent signals filtered by `setupClass`); Signals tab status sub-filters (TP / SL / Invalidated / Expired) when "Closed" is active; new `lib/shared/format.dart` pure-Dart price/PnL/pct/age helpers (used in Signals page; Pulse + Trade retrofit deferred to v0.0.10)
- **Lumin app file pipeline** — installer scripts (`tools/lumin-v00X.sh`) live in this repo; owner runs them from Termux on phone via `curl ...lumin-vXXX.sh | bash` → push → GitHub Actions builds signed APK

## Open Queue

### Held — investigation paused per owner direction
- **SR_FLIP_RETEST 0% win rate, paid-volume drought.** Latest backfilled history confirms: most closes are small-pct invalidations or breakevens, **zero TP hits** visible in the recent terminal set. SR_FLIP is the dominant emitter but mostly watchlist-tier; the few that clear paid threshold underperform. The most-valuable next bite given the visible win-rate problem.
- **OI-flip soft-penalty doctrine audit.** With KZ now uniformly disabled, OI flip is the dominant soft-penalty bottleneck — DIV_CONT filtered 100% of penalty from OI; FAR 91%; LSR 100%; SR_FLIP kept 100%. Same KZ-style question: is OI flip a 24/7-crypto-doctrine gate or inherited noise?

### Pending data
- **TP1 ATR cap re-derivation** (1.8R / 2.5R / uncapped on SR_FLIP / FUNDING / DIV_CONT / CLS) — wait for Phase 1 invalidation audit data on TP1 hit rates per setup × ATR-bucket
- **VSB / BDS generated-but-not-emitted** — VSB candidates land 19 below paid B-tier even un-penalised; BDS structurally silent (regime_blocked dominant). Diagnosed; no scoring fix would help
- **FAR `STRONG_TREND` regime block** — empirical conjecture, not structural impossibility. Could be soft penalty per doctrine; needs win-rate data
- **LSR hard 1H MTF reject in TRENDING/VOLATILE** — narrow filter, barely fires per recent telemetry. Could be soft per doctrine

### Pending owner decision
- **OPENING_RANGE_BREAKOUT** — currently `feature_disabled` (`scalp.py:2337`). Rebuild with proper session-anchored range logic, or delete. Not a CTE call
- **v0.1.0 settings-persistence architecture** — five decisions awaiting owner sign-off (Telegram-bot auth, SQLite storage, env-ceiling validator, per-agent toggle endpoint, scope). Major-architecture per OWNER_BRIEF §1.3

### Pending small follow-ups
- **Lumin v0.0.10 polish** — retrofit `format.dart` helpers (`formatPrice` / `formatPnl` / `formatPct` / `formatAge`) into Pulse + Trade pages. Small installer
- **Reconciler default flip** — `RECONCILER_AUTO_CLOSE_ORPHANS=true` so the periodic 5-min sweep auto-closes any broker position the engine forgot to. Belt-and-braces for any future code path that misses a `close_full` call. ~5-line PR
- **Historical perf JSON cleanup (optional)** — pre-merge invalidations stay labelled `"CLOSED"` in `data/signal_performance.json` itself (PR #305 fixes the user-visible signal_history but not the perf JSON). One-shot migration if owner wants the truth-report win-rate stats also corrected for the historical set

### Free-channel content rollout
**Phase 1 — Macro events to free channel** ✅ shipped (HIGH/CRITICAL only)
**Phase 2a — BTC big-move alert** ✅ shipped (≥3% / ≥5%, 1h cooldown)
**Phase 2b — BTC/ETH regime-shift alert** ✅ shipped (1h EMA21 cross, 4h cooldown)
**Phase 2 (still open) — additional event triggers** — BTC dominance ±2% (needs extra data source)
**Phase 3 — Charts attached to scheduled posts** — `src/chart_renderer.py` using mplfinance; attached to morning brief / EOD wrap / event-driven alerts
**Phase 4 — Coin spotlights** — top mover / breakout watch daily posts with charts
**Phase 5 — Signal-close storytelling** ✅ shipped (TP3 / SL mirror to free channel with `📣 Paid Signal Result` header)

### Pre-TP grab — Phase A ✅ shipped + ENABLED in production
- `TradeMonitor._check_pre_tp_grab` fires on ATR-adaptive threshold within 30 min, non-trending regime, non-breakout setup
- **Threshold + trigger price stamped at dispatch** (PR #301) — `pre_tp_threshold_pct` + `pre_tp_trigger_price` on `Signal` dataclass; `stamp_pre_tp` invoked from `Scanner._enqueue_signal` after universal SL-floor adjustment; `trade_monitor` prefers stamped values, backfills if missing (legacy in-flight signals)
- Falls back to static `PRE_TP_THRESHOLD_PCT` (0.35%) when ATR unavailable
- Symbolic + breakeven SL — no broker partial; subscriber sees the message and chooses
- Posts to active + free channels with raw and net-of-fees math at 10x
- Free-channel post emits `free_channel_post source=pre_tp` for truth-report attribution
- Setup blacklist: VSB / BDS / ORB; Regime allowlist: QUIET / RANGING / VOLATILE
- Telegram post shows: `⚡ Pre-TP @ 2,374.74 (+0.20% raw, ≥+1.3% net @ 10x) → SL → breakeven (auto)`
- 27 base + 21 stamping + 4 telegram render tests

## Session-end snapshot from owner's app screenshots (post-PR-#304 deploy)

After backfill ran the app showed real historical data:
- Pulse Recent signals card populated (ETHUSDT, XAUUSDT, SKYAIUSDT)
- Signals All / Closed views populated with 4 historical entries
- Closed → SL sub-filter showed BASEDUSDT 8d ago, MOVRUSDT 10d ago
- Closed → Invalidated **was empty (BUG)** because pre-PR-#305 the perf records mis-labelled invalidations as "CLOSED" → fixed in PR #305
- Agent drill-down populated: Architect (9h ago), Reclaimer (8d), Coil Hunter (3d), Counter-Puncher (never fired)
- Trade activity log populated

After PR #305's reconciliation runs on the next boot, the Closed → Invalidated sub-filter should populate with the same historical signals that currently show as "CLOSED" in the All view.

## Working Pattern

For any future code change:
1. Ask: **"how does this make signals more profitable for paid subscribers?"**
2. If answer is unmeasurable, "engineering hygiene," or speculative — **defer or drop**.
3. If answer is measurable (win rate, signal volume, R:R, time-to-resolution, fewer subscriber-visible failures), proceed: investigate, implement, test, document, ship.

For Lumin app changes:
1. All app dev happens in Termux on owner's phone — no Android Studio.
2. Installer scripts (`tools/lumin-v00X.sh`) live in **360-v2 engine repo** (this repo), curl'd from raw GitHub on phone, bashed in `~/lumin-app`. Each installer must be Termux-safe (bash + GNU sed/awk only).
3. Surgical patches preferred over full-file replacements when the change is localised — survives forward edits and fails loud on drift.
4. Every installer bumps `pubspec.yaml` version + commits with descriptive message; `git push` triggers GitHub Actions APK build with signed-when-keystore-set release.

For data correctness:
1. **Don't optimise based on `outcome_label`** without checking whether it's been corrected by `reconcile_invalidation_status`. Pre-PR-#305 perf records label every invalidation `"CLOSED"`. Truth-report parsing of those records is similarly biased.
2. Persistence is at three layers: in-memory `_signal_history` (App-API source) → `data/signal_history.json` (engine-restart durability) → `data/signal_performance.json` + `data/invalidation_records.json` (canonical history sources, used for backfill + reconcile). Treat invalidation_records as the truth-source for INVALIDATED.
