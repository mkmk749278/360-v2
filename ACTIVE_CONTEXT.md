## 🟢 SESSION 29 2026-06-18 — SR_FLIP/RANGING bleed remedies ACTIVATED on VPS (3 dark flags flipped live)

**Owner trigger:** "analyse signals quality after yesterday's PRs — where are we lagging."
Pulled a **fresh** truth report (monitor-logs, 2026-06-18 07:34 UTC — post-Session-28)
+ the attached `signal_performance` (277 closed sigs, Jun 15–18), `signal_history`
(500), `invalidation_records` (118).

### Finding: yesterday's work didn't touch the bleed
Session 27–28 (#614–#621) was all **scoring/generation on the dead paths**
(VSB/BDS/MA_CROSS/TPE) — correct work, but those paths are a volume rounding error
(VSB n=2, BDS n=7, TPE n=4 in the 277). The actual P&L drag is **unchanged since
Session 24**:
- **SR_FLIP_RETEST −4.80 (n=108 = 39% of all signals).** Upside-down R:R: avg win
  +0.33 vs avg loss −0.42, 63 SL hits. Concentrated in **RANGING −5.50 (60 sigs,
  36 SL)**.
- **RANGING regime −2.22** (47% of volume) — the one losing regime besides tiny VOLATILE.
- **LONGs −2.50 (n=142)** vs SHORTs +7.43; 7 of 8 worst losers are LONG in
  RANGING/UP/VOLATILE — the slice #615's TRENDING_DOWN gate does NOT catch.
- Book gross +4.94% raw (~thin); 24 full-SL events (−25.6 raw) wipe most of the
  +49.4 pre-TP banking. Net ≈ breakeven-to-negative after fees.
- Profitable engine (leave alone): DIVERGENCE_CONTINUATION +6.94, FAILED_AUCTION_RECLAIM +4.37.
- Invalidation audit healthy (76% PROTECTIVE, momentum_loss +0.36R/kill) — the
  KILLS aren't the problem; RANGING SR_FLIP entry quality + exit geometry is.

**The disconnect:** the remedies for this bleed (#603/#604/#608/#613) were merged
and shipped **dark up to 11 days ago and never activated**. We'd been adding
scoring polish to paths that barely fire while the fix for 39% of our volume sat
switched off.

### Owner decision: activate the dark flags (one-shot, owner ran on VPS)
Three flags flipped live + engine `--force-recreate` (verified True×3):
| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RANGING_LOW_ATR_LOSER_SUPPRESS_ENABLED=true` | drops low-ATR RANGING SR_FLIP/LSR entries (pctile ≤25) — cuts the −5.50 slice at the gate |
| `SR_FLIP_PRETP_R_SCALING_ENABLED=true` | floors pre-TP at SL_dist×0.35R so wide-SL SR_FLIPs stop banking at 0.2R |
| `INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_RSCALE_ENABLED=true` | trailing kill arms at min(0.80, 0.30+0.15×SL%) not flat 0.30R (global) |

`.env` backed up to `.env.bak.<ts>` before the change; one-line revert documented.
**No code shipped this session** — env-only activation. Expect signal VOLUME to drop
(RANGING SR_FLIP was 39% of flow) — intended trade, not a fault.

### NEXT SESSION — judge at +48h on a FRESH truth report (don't judge early):
| Metric | Baseline (this session) | Target |
|---|---|---|
| SR_FLIP `Avg PnL%` | −0.044 | → toward/above 0 |
| RANGING SR_FLIP slice | −5.50 (60 sigs) | → shrinking, fewer sigs |
| `trailing_invalidation` EV/kill | +0.09R (TUNE) | → above +0.10R (KEEP) |
| DIV + FAR | +6.94 / +4.37 | → unchanged (regression = back out) |

Shadow-confirm the drop volume:
`docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 48h 2>&1 | grep -c "RANGING_LOW_ATR_LOSER_SUPPRESS"`

### Still open after this (next levers, in order)
1. **LONG bleed** — −2.50, worst losers are LONG in RANGING/UP/VOLATILE; #615 only
   gates TRENDING_DOWN. Investigate extending the longs regime gate (shadow-first).
2. **SR_FLIP entry-quality re-tighten** (#612 kill-switch never merged; #613 dark
   re-tighten) — only if the 3 flags above don't pull RANGING SR_FLIP to ~breakeven.
3. **TPE generation gate** (82.6%-SL guard) — still deferred, shadow-first.

## ⏳ SESSION 28 CLOSE 2026-06-17 — scoring corrections shipped, NOW WAITING FOR DATA

**Do not re-diagnose VSB / BDS / TREND_PULLBACK_EMA / MA_CROSS_TREND_SHIFT off the
current truth report.** The latest `monitor-logs` truth report has **cumulative
counters that predate today's merges** — it still shows the *old* (pre-change)
emission. The four scoring/filter PRs below all merged today and auto-deployed;
their effect will only appear after a fresh data window accumulates. Next session:
**pull a fresh truth report first**, then judge.

**Merged today (all on `main`):**
| PR | Path(s) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| #618 | VOLUME_SURGE_BREAKOUT, BREAKDOWN_SHORT | regime floor 8→14; score volume off the validated breakout candle |
| #619 | MA_CROSS_TREND_SHIFT, TREND_PULLBACK_EMA | MA_CROSS regime 8→14; TPE volume floored at neutral 7.5 |
| #620 | MA_CROSS_TREND_SHIFT | HTF trend-alignment gate (1h cross must agree with 4h trend; 4h cross price-vs-EMA200 confirm) |
| #621 | TREND_PULLBACK_EMA | regime scored on the HTF (1H) trend via `htf_trend_aligned` → 18, not the 5m label |

Durable lesson promoted to `OWNER_BRIEF.md §3.6a` (Scoring Doctrine).

**Path emission snapshot (PRE-change, from stale truth report — for reference only):**
- Producing: SR_FLIP_RETEST 165, FAILED_AUCTION_RECLAIM 115, LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_REVERSAL 82, DIVERGENCE_CONTINUATION 32, VOLUME_SURGE_BREAKOUT 3, POST_DISPLACEMENT_CONTINUATION 1, QUIET_COMPRESSION_BREAK 1.
- 0-emit (today's targets): TREND_PULLBACK_EMA (571 gen), BREAKDOWN_SHORT (2225 gen), MA_CROSS (15 gen), + WHALE_MOMENTUM / FUNDING_EXTREME / LIQUIDATION_REVERSAL.
- Disabled: OPENING_RANGE_BREAKOUT (feature_disabled), CONTINUATION_LIQUIDITY_SWEEP (merged into LSR), TREND_PULLBACK_CONTINUATION (legacy).

**Open items / next levers (after data confirms):**
1. **TPE generation bottleneck still deferred** — the over-tight entry-quality gate (`no_prev_high_break` + `ema21_not_tagged`, the 82.6%-SL guard). Today's PRs fix TPE *scoring*, not *generation*. Do it shadow-first if data shows survivors scoring well but volume still low.
2. **kept-vs-emitted gap** — across all paths, confidence-"kept" is 10–30× "emitted". Likely expected dedup of the same signal across 15s cycles; **confirm dedup-vs-cull** before assuming a bug. Potentially the highest-leverage cross-path investigation.
3. **MA_CROSS will stay near-zero by nature** (15 gen; crosses are rare; #620 filter cuts further) — not a bug, don't loosen.
4. **WHALE_MOMENTUM / FUNDING_EXTREME / LIQUIDATION_REVERSAL** — 0-emit, low gen, not yet diagnosed this session.

## Session 28 checkpoint 2026-06-17 — TPE regime scored on the wrong timeframe (HTF-aware fix, research-backed, owner-approved)

### Owner trigger
Owner asked about the regime score for the TREND_PULLBACK_EMA path, then: "go
through deep research on crypto trend-pullback conditions / which timeframes
give best, then we decide."

### Research finding (web, multi-source)
Pullbacks are a **trending-market** setup ("step aside" in ranges). Canonical
multi-timeframe doctrine: **trend is defined on the HIGHER timeframe; entry is
timed on the LOWER** (HTF=trend → MTF=structure → LTF=entry). Rule repeated
everywhere: *"never trade against the HTF trend; always time entry on the LTF."*
EMA21 = canonical pullback-retest level, EMA50 = trend filter — our 1H EMA21/50
usage matches. This validates the evaluator's post-2026-05-17 redesign (trend on
1H, entry on 5m; the old 5m-trend version scored 78% MFE=0).

### Diagnosis
`_score_regime` judges TPE on `ctx.regime_result.regime` — the **5m label**, the
*entry* TF. During the pullback the 5m label reads RANGING/QUIET, so TPE dropped
to **8** even though it only fires when the **1H is trending** (evaluator
precondition). Scoring the trend on the entry timeframe is the exact multi-TF
error the research warns against.

### Owner decision: HTF-aware regime score (the doctrinally-ideal option, not the quick 14-floor)
### Shipped (branch `feat/tpe-htf-regime-score`)
| Change | File |
|---|---|
| New `Signal.htf_trend_aligned` flag | `channels/base.py` |
| TPE stamps `sig.htf_trend_aligned = bool(_uses_1h_trend)` (True only on the 1H-trend path) | `channels/scalp.py` |
| New `ScoringInput.htf_trend_aligned` | `signal_quality.py` |
| `_score_regime`: trend-pullback family with `htf_trend_aligned` → full affinity **18** in any regime (scoped to `_FAMILY_TREND_PULLBACK`; legacy 5m-fallback path keeps the label score) | `signal_quality.py` |
| Scanner passes `sig.htf_trend_aligned` into `ScoringInput` | `scanner/__init__.py` |
| 5 scorer tests (`TestTrendPullbackHtfRegimeScore`) + 2 evaluator tests (`TestTrendPullbackHtfFlag`, incl. fires-under-RANGING-label) | `tests/test_signal_quality.py`, `tests/test_channels.py` |

CPU-only; no new reads/writes/hot-path cost. Full suite passes.
Still secondary to TPE's real generation bottleneck — the over-tight entry-quality
gate (82.6%-SL guard, `no_prev_high_break` + `ema21_not_tagged`) deferred in #619;
that's the next lever if we want TPE *generation* up (shadow-first).

## Session 28 checkpoint 2026-06-17 — MA_CROSS: filter is the edge, not the period (research-backed, owner-approved)

### Owner trigger
Owner: "understand crypto market and which ema works… go through research and
actually what works implement that."

### Research finding (web, multi-source — quant-signals, QuantifiedStrategies, hyrotrader, et al.)
**The EMA *periods* are second-order; the FILTER is the edge.** Consistent across
sources: raw MA crosses LOSE money in crypto (~60% of time ranging → whipsaws;
lag eats the move). 50/200 is the most robust *structural* pair (~40% win rate,
trend-following payoff — beat BTC buy-and-hold 2017-25 on 4h/6h); 9/21 etc. are
faster but whipsaw more. **Adding a higher-timeframe trend filter improves results
far more than tuning periods.** → Our existing periods (4h 50/200, 1h 21/50) are
already the research-favoured choices; the gap was the *filter*.

### Owner decision: HTF-alignment gate (periods unchanged)
Did NOT touch periods (research says don't). Added the filter that actually drives
the edge.

### Shipped (branch `feat/ma-cross-htf-alignment`)
| Change | File |
|---|---|
| 1h 21/50 cross now fires only when it agrees with the **4h structural trend** (ema50_4h vs ema200_4h); fails closed (`ma_cross_htf_unconfirmed`) if 4h unavailable, rejects (`ma_cross_htf_misaligned`) if counter-HTF | `channels/scalp.py` |
| 4h 50/200 cross gets a light **price-vs-EMA200 confirmation** (rejects failing/reverted crosses; fail-open if EMA200 missing) | `channels/scalp.py` |
| 5 tests (`TestHtfAlignmentGate`) | `tests/test_ma_cross_trend_shift.py` |

CPU-only; reuses 4h indicators already in scope — no new reads/writes/hot-path
cost. Reduces generation (filters do) in exchange for higher win quality — the
right trade for a paid A+/B-only channel. Full suite 5,618 pass.
Synergy with #619: the regime-neutral 14 + HTF gate together mean a 1h cross is
no longer regime-penalised AND is confirmed by the 4h trend.

### Declined (told owner, per "tell me when a direction is wrong")
Adding a faster 9/21 tier for more signals — research does not support it
(faster pairs whipsaw more). Quality over quantity.

## Session 28 checkpoint 2026-06-17 — TREND_PULLBACK + MA_CROSS scoring deficits (scoring-only fix, owner-approved)

### Owner trigger
Owner: "trend pull back and ma cross trend shift — concentrate on them." Same
data-first deep dive as VSB/BDS, off the live truth report.

### Root cause (per-path)
- **MA_CROSS_TREND_SHIFT** (15 generated, 0 emitted): generation is **inherently
  sparse and correct** — a golden/death cross is a once-in-days event
  (`no_ma_cross` 69%); the 24h cooldown is right. The fixable bug: MA_CROSS was
  **absent from every `_REGIME_SETUP_AFFINITY` list and the neutral set** →
  `_score_regime` returned a flat **8.0** in all regimes. A cross fires AT the
  regime turn (5m label still RANGING) → penalised for doing its job.
- **TREND_PULLBACK_EMA** (571 generated, 0 emitted): two layers.
  (1) Volume dimension scored the quiet pullback entry candle 3/15 — a healthy
  pullback is low-volume BY DESIGN. (2) The "entry-quality tightening" block
  (scalp.py ~1580-1609) demands a near-unicorn candle that both deep-wicks to
  tag EMA21 (`ema21_not_tagged`) AND closes above the prior high
  (`no_prev_high_break`) — crushing generation. (2) was added to fix an 82.6%
  SL rate, so it's money-risky to loosen.

### Owner decision: "scoring fixes only"
Shipped the two safe scoring corrections; **left the TPE entry gates untouched**
(TPE stays low-generation by choice — relaxing those gates re-imports the
82.6%-SL risk and would need shadow measurement first).

### Shipped (branch `feat/trendpullback-macross-scoring`)
| Change | File |
|---|---|
| `MA_CROSS_TREND_SHIFT` added to `_REGIME_NEUTRAL_SETUPS` → regime 8→14 (fires at the transition, like a counter-trend setup) | `signal_quality.py` |
| `_score_volume` floors the `_FAMILY_TREND_PULLBACK` family at neutral 7.5 — quiet pullback volume no longer scored 3/15; high-volume reclaims still earn more | `signal_quality.py` |
| 5 tests (`TestTrendPullbackAndMaCrossScoring`) | `tests/test_signal_quality.py` |

CPU-only scorer change; no hot-path reads/writes. Full suite 5,613 pass.

### Deferred (owner-gated, NOT done)
- **TPE entry-gate de-contradiction** (the `no_prev_high_break` + `ema21_not_tagged`
  double-bind). Highest lever for TPE *generation*, but money-risky — do it
  shadow-first if/when the owner wants the volume back.

## Session 27 checkpoint 2026-06-17 — top-mover breakout/breakdown paths were dying in the SCORER, not the gates (VSB/BDS)

### Owner trigger
Owner: "why are the remaining paths not producing signals" → "we have two special
paths for shorts and longs top movers, separate from the regular 75 — VSB and BDS
— go deep on them." Diagnosis driven off the live truth report (monitor-logs).

### Architecture recap
Movers (24h %-change ≥ `MOVER_PROMOTION_MIN_PCT`, vol ≥ `MOVER_PROMOTION_MIN_VOLUME`)
are promoted into the scan for `MOVER_PROMOTION_CYCLES` (5) with a **restricted
evaluator set: VSB (long, top gainers) + BDS (short, top losers) only**.

### Root cause (truth report, path-funnel + scoring-dimension tables)
Both evaluators correctly **removed their regime gate** (§3.4 "fire in any HTF
context") and the broken current-candle volume gate — but those fixes were
**never applied at the SCORING layer**, so the composite scorer kept punishing
them for the exact things that define them:
- **VSB dies on the Regime dimension (8 vs 18 kept).** `_score_regime` gives 8
  when the regime is known but the setup isn't in its affinity list. VSB/BDS are
  in TRENDING/VOLATILE affinity but NOT RANGING/QUIET — and a top gainer
  mid-pullback often reads RANGING/QUIET on 5m (market is 64% RANGING+QUIET). 10-pt
  deficit → lands ~61 vs the 65 floor. (My #614 unification increased the RANGING
  share, slightly worsening this.)
- **BDS dies on the Volume dimension (3 vs 12 kept).** `_score_volume` scores the
  current candle, but the BDS entry is a dead-cat bounce (low volume by design);
  the surge already fired on the breakdown candle, which the scorer never saw.

### Shipped (branch `feat/mover-breakout-scoring`, owner approved "both fixes, neutral floor")
| Change | File(s) |
|---|---|
| `_score_regime`: floor breakout-surge setups (`_BREAKOUT_SURGE_SETUPS` = VSB/BDS/ORB) at neutral 14 in non-affinity regimes instead of 8 | `signal_quality.py` |
| `_score_volume`: for those setups, score off the validated breakout-candle ratio (`breakout_volume_ratio`) instead of the low-volume entry candle; falls back to the entry ratio when unset | `signal_quality.py` |
| Evaluators stamp `sig.breakout_volume_ratio = breakout(/down)_vol / rolling_avg` | `channels/scalp.py` |
| New `Signal.breakout_volume_ratio` + `ScoringInput.breakout_volume_ratio` fields; scanner passes it through | `channels/base.py`, `signal_quality.py`, `scanner/__init__.py` |
| 8 scoring tests (`TestBreakoutSurgeScoring`) | `tests/test_signal_quality.py` |

Expected: VSB recovers ~10 regime pts, BDS ~9 volume pts → both clear 65 when
otherwise structurally sound, without touching any hard gate. No new hot-path
reads/writes (CPU-only scorer change). Owner-sign-off item (scoring model).

### Watch next session
- Truth report: VSB/BDS `Emitted` column should rise from ~0–3; confirm the
  `Regime`/`Volume` filtered-vs-kept gaps close for these two setups.
- The current truth report predates #614–#617 + this change — next report is the
  first to reflect all of them.

## Session 26 checkpoint 2026-06-17 — MTF trend definition unified + longs HTF-regime gate (PRs #614, #615 MERGED)

### Owner trigger
Continuing the signals-quality work: the 496-signal audit's losing bucket was
LONGs fired while the higher timeframe was rolling over. Owner approved the
"Option 2" fix (unify the trend definition, then gate longs on it).

### Root cause
Two contradictory definitions of "trend":
- **5m (`AdaptiveRegimeDetector._decide_adaptive`)** stamped TRENDING in the weak
  ADX zone (between the tier's ranging/trending floors) on EMA separation alone
  — even with ADX *decaying* — manufacturing trends from fading moves.
- **15m (`detect_regime_from_arrays`)** used a flat ADX≥25 floor, no weak zone,
  no tier profile — so a midcap at ADX 22 read TRENDING on 5m and RANGING on 15m
  *by construction*, making any MTF comparison meaningless.

### Shipped (branch `claude/google-services-cost-analysis-w61lnc`)
| PR | Change | File(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **#614 MERGED** | Weak-zone trends now require ADX **rising** (`adx_slope>0`); unknown slope → RANGING. `detect_regime_from_arrays` made **tier-aware** + same weak-zone rule, so 5m and 15m mean the same thing by "trend". | `regime.py`, `scanner/__init__.py`, `tests/test_regime_mtf_unification.py` (9 tests) |
| **#615 MERGED** | **Filter 1b** in `_prepare_signal`: drop a LONG when the unified 15m regime is TRENDING_DOWN. Env toggles `MTF_LONGS_REGIME_GATE_ENABLED` (default on) + `MTF_LONGS_REGIME_GATE_DARK` (measure-only). Telemetry: `mtf_longs_regime_eval/block/would_block`. | `scanner/__init__.py`, `tests/test_scanner.py` (`TestLongsRegimeGateInScanner`) |
| **follow-up (this session, in PR)** | **§3.4 doctrine bypass for Filter 1b**: breakout/tape/liquidation-reversal longs (`_SCALP_MTF_HARD_BLOCK_EXEMPT_SETUPS`) are NOT HTF-vetoed — a breakout into a down 15m IS the regime change. Owner chose "exempt them". Telemetry: `mtf_longs_regime_doctrine_bypass:360_SCALP:<setup>`. | `scanner/__init__.py`, `tests/test_scanner.py` |

Per the owner's audit, removing the losing longs bucket flipped the audited
book from **−14.1 to +3.0** (owner-supplied figure, not re-measured here).

### Watch next session
- **`/suppressed` → `mtf_longs_regime_block` vs `mtf_longs_regime_doctrine_bypass`**:
  confirm the live block volume tracks the audit, and see how many longs the
  §3.4 exemption preserves. Flip `MTF_LONGS_REGIME_GATE_DARK=true` to pull back
  to measure-only without a code redeploy.
- Shorts are intentionally ungated; only 15m is used (not 1h/4h) — both deliberate.

### Follow-up (not done)
- **Pre-existing API test red** (FastAPI `204` + `response_model` at app
  construction) is failing on `main` in CI's container — unrelated to these PRs,
  but a possible live `api`-container risk. Worth confirming the live FastAPI pin.

## Session 25 checkpoint 2026-06-16 — GCP cost spike was Firestore reads, not auth (PR #609, MERGED)

### Owner trigger
Owner shared the `lumin-app` GCP/Firebase billing screens: ₹4,558/mo with a
climbing forecast, asking why "phone-number authentication only" was costing
so much. The "App Engine" line dominated despite **no App Engine services
deployed**.

### Root cause (confirmed on live billing data)
- **99.9% of the bill is Cloud Firestore — ₹4,552 — and specifically READS.**
  Writes/deletes sat inside the free tier; the read free-tier quota was
  exceeded daily. **Phone Auth / SMS = ₹0 (0% of quota).** Auth was never the
  cost — it was a red herring.
- **Why "App Engine" with no App Engine services:** Firestore-in-Datastore-mode
  bills under the "App Engine" SKU grouping in GCP. Confirmed via Billing →
  SKU breakdown (Cloud Firestore ₹4,552.25, non-Firebase ₹5.88) + the Firebase
  Usage tab ("Reads: limit exceeded").
- **The leak:** `pretp_dispatcher._on_tick` ran a Firestore collection-group
  query on *every* mark-price tick (~1/sec × open symbols, 24/7) to find OPEN
  positions. The module header already flagged it as `O(N) per tick` debt.

### Shipped (branch `claude/google-services-cost-analysis-w61lnc`, PR #609 — MERGED to main)
| Change | File(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `_write_generation` counter, bumped on `put_position`/`delete_position`; `get_write_generation()` | `position_state.py` | the freshness signal |
| Per-symbol OPEN-positions cache gated on that generation (+ defensive 10s TTL) | `pretp_dispatcher.py` | removes Firestore from the per-tick hot path |
| Cache tests (generation invalidation, TTL expiry, per-symbol, put/delete bump) | `tests/test_pretp_dispatcher_cache.py` | 5 new; 325 in the exec suite pass; ruff clean |

Correctness: the cache cannot serve a stale `pretp_fired`/`state` and double-fire
— every mutation funnels through `put_position`/`delete_position`, both of which
bump the generation and invalidate. No change to pre-TP threshold/firing logic.

### Process changes (this session)
- **`CLAUDE.md` gained a "Cost Discipline" section** + a Hard Limit ("never add
  an uncached Firestore/network read to a hot loop") + an operating-standard
  bullet ("cost is a first-class concern"). Every future change is reviewed for
  cost the way it's reviewed for correctness.

### Follow-up (not done)
- **Full in-memory open-positions index** would eliminate even the cold-path
  query (zero reads). The generation-gated cache is the lower-risk first step;
  the index is the next optimisation if reads still register.
- **No PR-level CI exists** in this repo (only `deploy.yml` on push-to-main +
  manual `vps-monitor`). Local test/lint runs are the only pre-merge gate today
  — worth adding a PR test workflow.
- Confirm the bill drops after the engine redeploys with #609 (reads keep
  accruing until the new image is live).

## Session 24 checkpoint 2026-06-15 — signals-quality audit: the bleed is RANGING SR_FLIP/LSR, not the trending exits

### Owner trigger
Owner reported sustained losses (paper P&L 7d −$34.74) and asked for a full
audit "per path / per regime / per market / per pair" — why the auto engine
lags a manual trader.

### Root-cause findings (live data, last-100 signals Jun 13–15)
- **The bleed is RANGING, not trending.** RANGING = 67% of volume and −7.22%
  of the −8.7% aggregate. TRENDING_DOWN ≈ flat (−0.12%). The two exit flags
  that ARE on (`TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED=True`, `RETRACE_REGIME_AWARE=True`)
  only touch the ~26% trending slice — they cannot fix a RANGING bleed. That
  is why flipping them never moved P&L.
- **Concentrated in two setups:** SR_FLIP_RETEST −4.36% (45 sigs, +0.25/−0.38)
  and LIQUIDITY_SWEEP_REVERSAL −3.77% (20 sigs, +0.47/−0.73). Both ~1:2
  win:loss. FAILED_AUCTION_RECLAIM (+0.71, 67% win) and DIVERGENCE_CONTINUATION
  (+0.42, 60% win) are profitable — leave alone.
- **0 TP hits / 45 full SL / 55 pre-TP-or-invalidation** across 100. Wins are
  capped small while losers run to wide structural stops → upside-down R:R.
- **`entry_regime` is EMPTY on the monitor's signals_last100.json** even with
  #606 in the tree. signals_last100.json is monitor-augmented (carries
  non-dataclass fields), so this is NOT authoritative for live FSM state —
  but it is suspicious. AUTHORITATIVE CHECK PENDING (see open items): read
  `data/signal_history.json` (raw vars(sig) dump) on the VPS. If empty there,
  the Session-23 bug is back / engine image predates #606 → rebuild engine.
- Tokenized-stock blacklist confirmed working (none in last 100).

### Shipped this session (branch `claude/signals-quality-audit-yn1a1f`, NOT yet PR'd to main)
| Change | File(s) | Default | Reversible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Micro-cap momentum-kill bug fix — sub-$0.001 coins no longer get a 10×-tighter kill threshold (momentum is scale-invariant); `INVALIDATION_MOMENTUM_MICROCAP_MULT` default 1.0 | `config`, `trade_monitor.py` | **LIVE (1.0)** | env → 0.1 |
| `entry_regime`/`entry_regime_15m` stamped into `dispatch_log.json` | `signal_router.py` | live (telemetry) | n/a |
| RANGING low-ATR loser-suppression gate (SR_FLIP/LSR only, ATR%ile ≤ 25) | `config`, `scanner` | **DARK** + `[SHADOW]` | flag |

All tests green (913 passed in the scanner/quality/invalidation sweep; 4 + 8
new cases). No PR to main opened yet (owner batching the full package).

### Geometry rebuild (C) — DONE on branch (dark), owner sign-off to activate
- **SR_FLIP:** already built (#603 pre-TP R-scaling, #604 trailing-arm R-scale)
  — activation only.
- **LSR (this session):** win-side `LSR_PRETP_R_SCALING_ENABLED` (pre-TP
  R-scaling, mirror of #603) + loss-side `LSR_SL_TIGHTEN_ENABLED`
  (`LSR_MAX_SL_PCT_TIGHT` 1.5%). LSR is reject-not-compress, so the tighten
  DROPS wide-stop LSRs (no wick-out risk). Both dark + shadow.

### Remaining work (owner)
1. **Run the authoritative `entry_regime` check** (signal_history.json) + rebuild
   engine if empty — settles whether the trending exit-flags are actually live.
2. **Activation sequence (A)** — see runbook below, after merge + 48h shadow.

### Activation runbook (owner — after the entry_regime check + engine rebuild)
```bash
cd /root/360-v2
# AUTHORITATIVE entry_regime check (settles whether the trending flags are live):
docker exec 360scalp-v2-engine python -c "import json; d=json.load(open('data/signal_history.json')); r=sorted(d,key=lambda x:x.get('timestamp',0))[-6:]; [print(x.get('symbol'),repr(x.get('entry_regime'))) for x in r]"
# If empty -> rebuild so #606 is actually running:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile isolated up -d --no-deps --force-recreate engine
```
Then, once this branch is merged to main + deployed, read 48h of shadow counts
before flipping each flag:
```bash
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 48h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] RANGING_LOW_ATR_LOSER_SUPPRESS"
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 48h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] MICROCAP_MOMENTUM_SPARED"
```
Activation order (one at a time, measure between): SR_FLIP R-scaling (#603) →
trailing-arm R-scale (#604) → RANGING low-ATR suppression → revisit LSR geometry.

## Session 23 checkpoint 2026-06-10 — entry_regime empty bug found and fixed (PR #606)

### Root cause finding (drove the session)

`TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED` shadow telemetry (`DARK_FLAG_SHADOW_TELEMETRY=true`) returned
**0 hits after 48h** despite signals dispatching normally. Diagnosis: `sig.entry_regime`
was always `""` at dispatch time for every signal.

Bug in `_populate_signal_context` (`src/scanner/__init__.py`): `sig.entry_regime = rc.label`
was inside a `try` block that ran `float(rc.atr_percentile)` and `float(rc.adx_slope)` in
f-strings **above** it. When either `float()` raised `TypeError` or `ValueError`, the
`except` clause silently dropped the entire block — `entry_regime` was never written,
leaving the `Signal` default of `""`.

### Impact (two features were dead letters in production)

| Feature | PR | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED` shadow + real flag | #594 | `regime_label=""` → suppress condition always False; 0 shadow hits since deploy |
| Regime-per-exit FSM gating | #578 | `entry_regime=""` → all FSM regime checks silently bypassed on every dispatched position |

### Fix — PR #606 (merged 2026-06-10)

`sig.entry_regime = rc.label` hoisted above the `try` block. Pure string assignment,
cannot raise. The `float()` calls that may fail remain inside `try/except` as before.

### Action required on VPS after merge

```bash
# Rebuild engine image with the fix:
cd /root/360-v2
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile isolated up -d --no-deps --force-recreate engine

# Confirm shadow telemetry now fires (within hours of next TRENDING signal dispatch):
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine -f | grep "\[SHADOW\] TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED"

# Confirm entry_regime is now populated on dispatched positions:
docker exec 360scalp-v2-redis redis-cli hgetall snapshot:<uid> 2>/dev/null | grep entry_regime
```

### Open items (priority order)

1. **Deploy PR #606 on VPS** — `docker compose ... up -d --no-deps --force-recreate engine` after merge.
2. **Confirm shadow telemetry fires** — grep `[SHADOW] TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED` post-deploy; expect counts within hours.
3. **Re-verify regime-per-exit live (PR #578)** — with `entry_regime` now populated, confirm it is non-empty in Redis snapshot and FSM trail/cancel paths are actually being reached.
4. **TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED activation** — blocked on 7 days of shadow data post-#606 deploy. Do not activate blind.
5. **Change A activation on VPS** — `SR_FLIP_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED=3`; commands in Session 22 section below.
6. **#604 shadow telemetry → activation** — read `TRAILING_RSCALE_WOULD_SUPPRESS` count after 48h, then activate `INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_RSCALE_ENABLED=true`.
7. **Google Play approval** — awaiting email (submitted 2026-06-06, ≤7 days). Complete store listing + data-safety form while waiting.
8. **Scoring-model rebuild** — blocked on data accumulation in Ops score-band view.

## Session 22 checkpoint 2026-06-07 — SR_FLIP premature-kill audit + trailing R-scale arm

### Root cause finding (drove the session)

Owner ran `invalidation_records.json` audit on VPS. Among 16 PREMATURE SR_FLIP kills:

| Kill family | Count | Premature % |
|---|---|---|
| trailing_invalidation | 7 | **44%** |
| momentum_loss | 4 | 16% |
| other | 5 | — |

Root cause of `trailing_invalidation` dominance: the trailing kill **arms at a flat 0.30R** regardless of SL width. SR_FLIP structural SLs are 1.6–2.5% wide. At 0.30R × 1.6% SL ≈ 0.48% absolute, normal reversal pullbacks (>50% retrace) fire the kill near breakeven before the position has established real profit. EDGEUSDT was the canonical proof: entry 0.6472 SHORT, SL 1.63%, MFE 0.56% (+0.36% R) → killed at 0.06% by a retrace.

### What shipped this session (2 PRs merged)

| PR | What | Flag (default) | Shadow telemetry |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#603](https://github.com/mkmk749278/360-v2/pull/603) | **Change A**: SR_FLIP momentum-kill grace — per-setup `INVALIDATION_CONSECUTIVE_THRESHOLD` key (`360_SCALP::SR_FLIP_RETEST`) requires 3 vs 2 consecutive bad-momentum readings | `SR_FLIP_MOMENTUM_GRACE_ENABLED` (false) | `[SHADOW] SR_FLIP_GRACE_WOULD_SUPPRESS` |
| [#603](https://github.com/mkmk749278/360-v2/pull/603) | **Change B**: SR_FLIP pre-TP R-scaling — floors pre-TP threshold at `SL_dist_pct × 0.35R` so wide-SL signals don't bank at 0.20R | `SR_FLIP_PRETP_R_SCALING_ENABLED` (false) | `[SHADOW] SR_FLIP_RSCALE_WOULD_RAISE` |
| [#604](https://github.com/mkmk749278/360-v2/pull/604) | **R-scaled trailing-kill arm** — arm threshold becomes `min(0.80, 0.30 + 0.15 × sl_dist_pct)` globally for all setups; fixes the EDGEUSDT premature kill class | `INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_RSCALE_ENABLED` (false) | `[SHADOW] TRAILING_RSCALE_WOULD_SUPPRESS` |

Both PRs ship **completely dark** — no live behavior change on merge. 5566 tests pass, 0 failures.

### Change A activation (owner task — do now)

Owner decided to activate Change A immediately (momentum-kill grace for SR_FLIP, `SR_FLIP_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED=3`). Commands on VPS:

```bash
cd /root/360-v2
grep -q '^SR_FLIP_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED=' .env \
  && sed -i 's/^SR_FLIP_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED=.*/SR_FLIP_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED=3/' .env \
  || echo 'SR_FLIP_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED=3' >> .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile isolated up -d --no-deps --force-recreate engine
# Verify:
docker exec 360scalp-v2-engine python -c \
  "from config import INVALIDATION_CONSECUTIVE_THRESHOLD as c; print(c.get('360_SCALP::SR_FLIP_RETEST'))"
# → should print 3
```

### Activation sequence for #604 (read shadow data first)

After 48h with the new engine image deployed, check shadow counts:

```bash
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 48h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] TRAILING_RSCALE_WOULD_SUPPRESS"
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 48h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] SR_FLIP_GRACE_WOULD_SUPPRESS"
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 48h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] SR_FLIP_RSCALE_WOULD_RAISE"
```

When confident in shadow count, activate #604:
```bash
echo 'INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_RSCALE_ENABLED=true' >> /root/360-v2/.env
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile isolated up -d --no-deps --force-recreate engine
```

### New config constants (all in `config/__init__.py`)

```
SR_FLIP_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED          = 2       (3 when activated)
SR_FLIP_MOMENTUM_GRACE_ENABLED        = false
SR_FLIP_PRETP_R_SCALING_ENABLED       = false
SR_FLIP_PRETP_R_FACTOR                = 0.35
INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_RSCALE_ENABLED  = false
INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_R_PER_SL_PCT    = 0.15
INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_R_MAX           = 0.80
```

### Open items (priority order)

1. **Change A activation on VPS** — owner task, commands above. Verify 3 is live before enabling #604.
2. **#604 shadow telemetry** — read `TRAILING_RSCALE_WOULD_SUPPRESS` count after 48h, then activate `INVALIDATION_TRAILING_ARM_RSCALE_ENABLED=true`.
3. **Google Play approval** — awaiting email (≤7 days from 2026-06-06). Complete store listing / data-safety form while waiting.
4. **Scoring-model rebuild** — still blocked on data accumulation in the Ops score-band view.
5. **PR #594 (regime-aware exit)** — owner sign-off required. Do not auto-merge. Touches position FSM / regime-per-exit doctrine (§3.2b).
6. **Dark-flag shadow telemetry (session-19/20 flags)** — read counts before enabling `TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED`, `PRETP_FULLGRAB_ON_CANCEL_REGIME_ENABLED`, `INVALIDATION_BTC_CORRELATION_ENABLED`:
   ```bash
   docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 24h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED"
   docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 24h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] PRETP_FULLGRAB_ON_CANCEL"
   docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 24h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] INVALIDATION_BTC_CORRELATION"
   ```

Applied today 2026-06-06 at 18:06. Confirmation screen: "We have your application for production access." Google will email within 7 days.

**Remaining Play Console steps (complete while waiting for approval):**
1. Data safety form — use table in `docs/PLAYSTORE_SUBMISSION.md`
2. Store listing — name, short/full description, screenshots, feature graphic
3. Content rating — IARC questionnaire (answer truthfully; paper trading is not gambling)

## Session 20b checkpoint 2026-06-06 — universe cleanup + dark-flag measurability

Continuation of session 20. Two follow-ups from the list below cleared, plus
the companion lumin-app production-UI pass.

### What shipped this session (3 PRs merged)

| PR | Repo | What | Live effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#596](https://github.com/mkmk749278/360-v2/pull/596) | 360-v2 | Tokenized-stock blacklist — AVGOUSDT/QQQUSDT/SKHYNIXUSDT/DRAMUSDT added to `SCAN_SYMBOL_BLACKLIST` | **Live on merge.** Those 4 pairs no longer scanned. |
| [#597](https://github.com/mkmk749278/360-v2/pull/597) | 360-v2 | Shadow telemetry for the 3 dark exit flags — logs `[SHADOW]` lines when a flag *would* fire while off | **Live on merge** (log-only, trade-neutral). `DARK_FLAG_SHADOW_TELEMETRY=true` default. |
| [#92](https://github.com/mkmk749278/lumin-app/pull/92) | lumin-app | Production UI: paper-first journey, removed engine-internal "75 pairs" copy, wired Telegram subscribe deep link, prominent paper-reset button | Merged. |

**#596 evidence (verified, not assumed):** pulled `origin/monitor-logs`
`signals_last100.json` + `dispatch_log.json` — all 4 symbols were actively
firing to the paid channel (AVGO 8×, QQQ 6×, SKHYNIX 3×, DRAM 1× of last
100), quotes track equity prices ($55–$1366), near-exclusively SHORT. Class-C
misfit per `docs/SYMBOL_CLASS_RESEARCH_2026_05_23.md`.

**#597 design:** flag-independent predicates shared by the real apply-funcs
and the shadow path (count can't drift from the gate); BTC shadow eval only on
the adverse-excursion path, TTL-cached, skipped entirely when master flag off.
49 tests pass.

### Now measurable from prod logs (before flipping the real flags)

```bash
# Count how often each dark flag WOULD have fired in recent logs:
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 24h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED"
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 24h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] PRETP_FULLGRAB_ON_CANCEL"
docker logs 360scalp-v2-engine --since 24h 2>&1 | grep -c "\[SHADOW\] INVALIDATION_BTC_CORRELATION"
```

Read these counts before enabling `TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED` (the first flag
in the activation sequence below) so the blast radius is known in advance.

### Open follow-up from #596 (owner call)

Research doc also lists older tokenized stocks `CRCL/MU/INTC/CL/EWY` (already
100% QUIET-blocked). Not added — couldn't re-verify them in the current
100-signal window. Fold into the blacklist as a complete sweep, or leave them?

## Session 20 checkpoint 2026-06-06 — regime-aware exit (TRENDING runner fix)

### Research finding (drove the session)

Binance realized P&L analysis of 107 closed positions proved the profit/loss split is almost entirely explained by HOW LONG a position runs:

| Hold duration | Count | Net P&L | Win rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| > 40 minutes | 9 | **+$1.049** | 67% |
| < 40 minutes | 98 | **-$0.492** | 39% |

Pearson r(hold_minutes, PnL) = **+0.379**. The top-4 realized winners (NEAR +$0.348, NEAR +$0.291, WIF +$0.213, XPLV2 +$0.183) ran 47–68 minutes. The signal book had already PROFIT_LOCKEd those signals at 2–6 min while the Binance bracket kept running.

**Root cause split:**
- RANGING/QUIET markets: pre-TP + tight trailing-kill work correctly — contain chop losses, bank small wins
- TRENDING markets: the same mechanisms cut the exact positions that generate all profit. Pre-TP banks 50% at +0.35%; trailing-kill at 50% MFE retrace fires on normal continuation pauses (pullbacks routinely retrace 50-65% of a trend leg without reversing)

### What shipped this session (1 PR, owner sign-off required)

| PR | Repo | What | Flag (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#594](https://github.com/mkmk749278/360-v2/pull/594) | 360-v2 | Regime-aware exit: suppress pre-TP + widen trailing-kill in TRENDING | see below |

**PR #594 — owner sign-off required.** Do not auto-merge. Touches position FSM / regime-per-exit doctrine (§3.2b).

### New env flags — activation when ready

| Flag | Default | Effect when `true` |
|---|---|---|
| `TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED` | `false` | Zero grab fraction for TRENDING_UP/DOWN signals → full position rides the trend |
| `INVALIDATION_TRAILING_RETRACE_REGIME_AWARE` | `false` | TRENDING signals use wider retrace threshold (default 0.70 vs 0.50 baseline) |
| `INVALIDATION_TRAILING_RETRACE_PCT_TRENDING` | `0.70` | Override the TRENDING retrace threshold (tune after observing) |

**Recommended activation sequence:**
1. Merge PR #594 (owner sign-off)
2. Enable `TRENDING_PRETP_SUPPRESSED=true` first — measurable via whether TRENDING signals run longer on Binance
3. After a week of data, enable `INVALIDATION_TRAILING_RETRACE_REGIME_AWARE=true`
4. Compare hold-time distribution + net P&L against session 20 baseline

### Also confirmed this session

- `PRE_TP_REGIME_ALLOWLIST = "QUIET,RANGING,VOLATILE"` (config) is enforced by `trade_monitor.py` for the signal book, but the **server-side FSM dispatch path** (`resolve_pretp_allowlists_uid`) returns allow-all by default when no user DB setting exists — TRENDING regime signals WERE getting pre-TP fired via the FSM. PR #594 fixes this at the dispatch level.

### Open follow-ups (carry-forward from session 19)

1. **Scoring-model rebuild** — blocked on data accumulation in the new Ops score-band view
2. ~~**Tokenized stock exclusion**~~ — ✅ **DONE** in PR #596 (session 20b). AVGOUSDT/QQQUSDT/SKHYNIXUSDT/DRAMUSDT added to `SCAN_SYMBOL_BLACKLIST`.
3. ~~**Shadow telemetry for dark flags**~~ — ✅ **DONE** in PR #597 (session 20b). `DARK_FLAG_SHADOW_TELEMETRY=true` default; `[SHADOW]` lines now in prod logs.

## Session 19 checkpoint 2026-06-05 — scoring research + BTC-in-invalidation + CANCEL-path fee fix

### Research finding (drove the whole session)

Owner supplied a 107-signal Ops report pairing **confidence score with outcome**. Decisive result: **Pearson r(confidence, PnL) = −0.027** — the confidence score has **no predictive power** over outcome. Raising the score threshold only cuts volume, it does **not** improve quality (the "trade 80+ only" idea = 4 signals, still net-negative). The real discriminators are **setup identity** (FAILED_AUCTION_RECLAIM / FUNDING positive; SR_FLIP_RETEST / LSR / BREAKDOWN negative) and **exit geometry**, not the score. Owner direction: do **not** pause setups — research paths, fix structurally, consider BTC correlation.

### What shipped this session (3 PRs merged)

| PR | Repo | What | Flag (default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| #591 | 360-v2 | BTC correlation in the **invalidation** system — tightens adverse-excursion exit when BTC 1H+4H oppose an open position | `INVALIDATION_BTC_CORRELATION_ENABLED` (false) |
| #592 | 360-v2 | **Full-grab pre-TP on CANCEL-bound regimes** — closes full position at the pre-TP LIMIT instead of partial+market-close (2 maker fees not 3, no residual slippage) | `PRETP_FULLGRAB_ON_CANCEL_REGIME_ENABLED` (false) |
| #11 | 360ce-ops | Performance page: **score-band table + live Pearson r(confidence, PnL)**; fixed `PROFIT_LOCKED` not counted as a win | — (read-only) |

**All three engine changes ship DARK** — merges were behavior-neutral. Nothing changes live until the flags are flipped on the VPS.

### New env flags — how to A/B them on the VPS

| Flag | Effect when `true` | Companion tunables |
|---|---|---|
| `INVALIDATION_BTC_CORRELATION_ENABLED` | Open position that is losing **and** fighting BTC's 1H+4H trend exits earlier (adverse fraction × mult). Tape-driven setups exempt; fail-open on missing BTC data. | `INVALIDATION_BTC_ADVERSE_FRACTION_MULT` (0.70), `INVALIDATION_BTC_DIRECTION_CACHE_TTL_SEC` (60) |
| `PRETP_FULLGRAB_ON_CANCEL_REGIME_ENABLED` | RANGING/QUIET-entry pre-TP closes 100% at the LIMIT (fee win, ~76% of cycles). Identical exit, 1 fewer fee. | — |

Validate enabling either against the truth report's PROTECTIVE/PREMATURE classifier + the new Ops score-band view.

### Open follow-ups (next session)

1. **Scoring-model rebuild** — "each score point should filter." Blocked on data: let the new Ops score-band view + per-setup outcomes accumulate (~days), then rebuild scoring on the components that actually discriminate (MTF/SMC look strongest; needs confirmation from real per-component outcome data — do **not** rebuild blind).
2. **SRFLIP/LSR geometry** — the small-win/big-loss asymmetry is the core bleed; the CANCEL fee fix (#592) trims fees but does not flip profitability. Investigate SL placement vs known liquidity clusters + pre-TP threshold sizing.
3. **Settings reset to defaults** — one-time VPS SQLite/API op when owner wants a clean baseline (pre-TP on, grab 0.50, threshold 0.35% ATR-adaptive, invalidation `tight`).
4. **Shadow telemetry for #591/#592** — optional: log when the dark overlays *would* fire so impact is measurable before flipping the flags live.

### Monitoring agent (360ce-ops) — fully operational

24/7 monitoring agent deployed as a separate Docker container (`360ce-ops-agent`) on the VPS.

**Architecture:**
- **Tier 0** — 7 deterministic detectors polling every 60s, paging Telegram on money-path failures
- **Tier 2** — healthchecks.io dead-man switch (Period=1min, Grace=2min), green since 08:02

**Active detectors:**

| ID | Name | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | NakedPositionDetector | Position with `entry>0`, valid symbol, `stop_loss≤0` for >1 cycle |
| D2 | BackgroundTaskDetector | Any of `trade_monitor / reconciler / mark_price_feed / funding_exit_watcher` absent from task census |
| D3 | AutoModeDisabledDetector | `auto_mode=false` for >15 min |
| D4 | StaleSnapshotDetector | Engine snapshot not updated in >90s |
| D6 | BinanceKeyMissingDetector | Binance key disconnected |
| D7 | PositionCountAnomalyDetector | Open position count changes by >5 in one cycle |
| D8 | RedisIdleDetector | `snapshot:tickers` Redis key idle >120s |

**False positives eliminated:**
- D1: requires `symbol != ""` and `entry > 0.0` — ignores Redis-facade signal-tracking placeholders
- D2: empty census (unavailable) treated as `[]` skip, not "all dead"
- D5 (heartbeat_stale): removed entirely — file mtimes don't correlate with scan cycles

**Known limitation (D1):** reads `sig.stop_loss` geometry, cannot detect the real case (valid SL price, Binance stop order not yet confirmed). Proper fix requires engine to publish `sl_order_id` per position to Redis snapshot. Tracked as follow-up.

### PR #585 — reconciler positionRisk overflow (confirmed fixed)

Root cause: `asyncio.open_unix_connection` default 64 KiB `readline` limit raised
`ValueError: Separator is not found, and chunk exceed the limit` when
`/fapi/v2/positionRisk` returned >64 KiB of JSON (all symbols, no filter).
Fix: raised `_SOCKET_READ_LIMIT` to 16 MiB. Confirmed working — empty grep for
`Separator is not found` in VPS logs post-deploy.

### Scan latency — root cause + fix (#587 then #588), CONFIRMED FIXED

**Production timing that drove the work (`smc_indicators` summed / cycle wall-clock):**
```
{'smc_indicators': 758.51, ...}  cycle=71.8s
{'smc_indicators': 866.61, ...}  cycle=75.3s
```

**Two distinct bugs, fixed across two PRs:**

1. **SMC never cached** (#587) — `smc_detector.detect` ran fresh every cycle even though
   sweeps / FVGs / orderblocks are deterministic on completed candles. Added `_smc_cache`
   keyed on closed 5m+ candle counts. **This part worked.**

2. **Indicator cache used one whole-dict fingerprint including 1m** (#587 got this wrong;
   #588 fixed it). A new 1m candle closes ~every cycle, so the combined fingerprint
   changed every cycle and invalidated indicators for ALL 7 timeframes — 5m..1w were
   recomputed needlessly. #587 showed **no improvement in prod** (541-822s) because the
   single timing bucket lumped SMC + indicators, masking the working SMC cache.

**#588 fix (the real win):** indicator cache keyed PER TIMEFRAME — `symbol → {tf: (len, ind)}`.
Only timeframes whose candle count changed recompute. 1m recomputes every cycle (scalping
needs the live bar); 5m..1w hit ~95%. Telemetry split into separate `smc` / `indicators`
buckets to make it self-verifying.

**Confirmed in production (post-#588):**
```
cycle=2.5–5.7s   {'indicators': 0.0, 'smc': 0.0}            ← most cycles, fully cached
cycle=12.4s      {'indicators': 97.1, 'smc': 0.0}           ← 1m candle closed
cycle=16.0s      {'indicators': 136.4, 'smc': 45.6}         ← 1m + 5m closed
```
**Cycle wall-clock 64s → ~3s typical, ~16s worst-case** (at candle boundaries). `smc` is
0 on every cycle except 5m closes — proving the #587 SMC cache was working all along.

### Positions tab — two isolated-mode false-negatives (#589, #590), FIXED

Both surfaced from owner screenshots of the dashboard Positions tab. Root cause in both
cases: the isolated `api` container serves from `RedisEngineFacade`, which lacks the live
engine objects the single-process build assumes are present.

1. **`monitor_running: NO` false-negative (#589).** The diag derived liveness from
   `getattr(engine, "monitor", None)._running`. The facade has no `.monitor` object, so it
   always read `None` → "NO" — even though the Redis task census showed `trade_monitor
   ALIVE: True`. Fix: when no `.monitor` object exists, derive `monitor_running` from the
   published task census (`get_background_task_census()` → any name containing
   `trade_monitor`). Single-process path unchanged.

2. **Blank/zero Positions X-ray rows (#590).** `build_positions_diag` needs live
   `router.active_signals` (full signal geometry: SL/TP, entry) AND `data_store` candle
   wicks to compute the SL-breach / candle-age columns. In isolated mode the facade only
   carries `_MockSignal` stubs (signal_id + timestamps) and `data_store is None`, so active
   positions rendered as blank-symbol, all-0.0 rows. Fix: the engine computes the diag
   itself (it has the real objects) and publishes the rendered rows to a new Redis key
   `snapshot:positions_diag` (TTL 60s) via `SnapshotWriter._write_positions_diag`; the API
   handler serves `engine.published_positions_diag()` when present, falling back to a live
   build in single-process mode. Mirrors the task-census pattern from #584.

   Files: `src/api/snapshot_store.py` (key + TTL), `src/api/snapshot_writer.py` (writer),
   `src/api/redis_engine.py` (`published_positions_diag()` + refresh), `src/api/server.py`
   (handler). 444 API tests green.

**Telemetry silenced:** `SCAN_STAGE_TIMING_ENABLED=false` written to VPS `/root/360-v2/.env`.
NOT yet applied (engine env is baked at container creation; deploy is `paths-ignore` for
`.env`/docs). **Takes effect on the next code deploy** — until then the timing line still
logs every ~3s. Deferred deliberately to keep the telemetry through high-volatility
conditions for confidence.

### Open items (priority order)

1. **Telemetry auto-silences on next code deploy** — `SCAN_STAGE_TIMING_ENABLED=false`
   already in `/root/360-v2/.env`; the next PR-to-main deploy recreates the engine and
   applies it. No action needed unless the ~3s log cadence becomes a problem sooner
   (then `docker compose --profile isolated up -d --no-deps --force-recreate engine`).
2. **Verify Positions X-ray post-#590 deploy** — confirm the Positions tab renders active
   signals with real symbol / SL / TP / candle-wick columns (not blank-0.0 rows), and
   `monitor_running: YES`. `snapshot:positions_diag` should be present in
   `redis-cli KEYS "snapshot:*"`; the same code deploy also applies
   `SCAN_STAGE_TIMING_ENABLED=false`.
3. **D1 NakedPositionDetector upgrade** — currently geometry-only (`stop_loss≤0`).
   Real naked-position detection (Binance stop order not placed) requires engine to
   publish `sl_order_id` per position in the Redis snapshot. Design needed.
4. **Verify regime-per-exit live** (PR #578) — `place_trailing_stop_market`/`trail_sl`
   in engine logs on TRENDING-aligned exits; `entry_regime`/`atr_value_at_entry`
   non-empty on dispatched positions; clean RANGING/QUIET market-closes.
5. **Verify funding-exit watcher live** (PR #581) — grep `funding_exit_watcher: exiting`;
   confirm `get_funding_info` populated near a settlement cycle.

## Session 17 checkpoint 2026-06-04 — regime-per-exit FSM + signing healthcheck + funding-exit watcher

### What shipped this session (5 PRs merged to `main`)

| PR | What | Type |
|---|---|---|
| #577 | Hurst gate + ATR trail width + multi-TF regime stamp | merged |
| #578 | Regime-per-exit FSM (TRAIL/VOLATILE/CANCEL) | owner sign-off, merged |
| #579 | ACTIVE_CONTEXT correction | docs, auto-merged |
| #580 | Signing service Docker healthcheck fix | ops, auto-merged |
| #581 | Funding-exit watcher (real funding data) | owner sign-off (delegated), merged |

#### PR #580 — signing container healthcheck (`c7c9081`)

`360scalp-v2-signing` shared the engine image whose Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK checks
for a `src.main` process + scanner heartbeat — neither exist in the signing
container, so it reported `unhealthy` after the 180s grace period despite serving
correctly. Fixed with a `healthcheck:` override in `docker-compose.yml`:
`test -S /app/sock/signing.sock` (socket created after KMS+Firestore init; stale
sockets unlinked on startup). **The long-standing "signing unhealthy" open item is
now resolved** — verify `docker ps` shows healthy after next redeploy.

#### PR #581 — funding-exit watcher (`2e99d7d`)

Exits positions that would PAY material funding within the pre-funding window.
Research (Binance docs) drove two key design choices:
- **Funding interval is not always 8h** (4h/8h/1h per pair) → read the real
  `nextFundingTime` per symbol from the mark-price stream.
- **The mark-price stream already carries `r` + `T`** — `MarkPriceFeed` was
  discarding them. Now captured via `get_funding_info(symbol)`.

Exit rule: `next_funding − now ≤ PRE_FUNDING_EXIT_WINDOW_SEC` (120s) AND paying
side AND `|rate| ≥ PRE_FUNDING_MIN_RATE` (0.05%). TRAILING positions skipped.
`close_reason="FUNDING_EXIT"`. Disable with `PRE_FUNDING_EXIT_WINDOW_SEC=0`.

#### Regime-per-exit FSM (PR #578) — full implementation

Owner-approved exit matrix (§3.2b):

| Post-pre-TP regime | Exit path |
|---|---|
| TRENDING + 15m confirm + aligned | **TRAIL** — Binance native `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET` |
| TRENDING (any condition mismatched) | **CANCEL** — immediate market close |
| RANGING / QUIET | **CANCEL** — immediate market close |
| VOLATILE | **VOLATILE** — tighten static SL by 20% |

Bugs fixed bundled:
1. `_apply_close_fill` — "close" phase fills were silently ignored (no dispatch table entry)
2. `_apply_tp2_fill` — when `tp3_qty == 0`, FSM was stranding in TP2_HIT forever

## Session 16 checkpoint 2026-06-03 — monitor watchdog + signing service aiohttp fix

**360-v2 PR #573** merged to main:

1. **`src/bootstrap.py` — `_resilient_monitor_loop` watchdog** — wraps `TradeMonitor.start()`
   in a self-healing loop; 5s backoff on exit, cleans up on normal `stop()`.
2. **`src/security/signing_service/server.py` — aiohttp chunk limit** raised from 8 KB
   to 64 KB. Fixes Reconciler WARNING on large `positionRisk` responses.

## Session 14 checkpoint 2026-06-03 — isolation cutover LIVE + post-cutover bug sweep

`API_PROCESS_ISOLATED=true` live on VPS. Engine runs `SnapshotWriter` only; separate
`api` container serves HTTP via `RedisEngineFacade`. Scanner-contention symptom resolved.

PRs #565 / #567 / #568 / #569 all merged. Three root causes fixed:
1. Missing `API_PROCESS_ISOLATED` in VPS `.env` → SnapshotWriter never started
2. Missing `init_keystore()` in api container → Binance key always ❌
3. Missing `init_kill_switch()` in api container → engine-wide enabled always ❌

**Policy adopted (owner standing authorisation, 2026-06-03):** CTE auto-merges PRs
once CI green / no conflicts / not an owner-sign-off item.
