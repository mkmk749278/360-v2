"""DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging / Double Entry) logic for 360-Crypto-scalping.

When a trade dips after Entry 1 but still has good momentum/structure, a 2nd
entry is taken at the lower price.  The averaged entry is now lower, so when
price returns to Entry 1's level the trade is already at breakeven or small
profit.  After taking the 2nd entry, all TPs are recalculated from the new
averaged entry using the same R-multiples (tp_ratios) from the channel config.

Key constraints
---------------
* Max 2 entries — no 3rd entry (not martingale).
* SL stays fixed at the original structural invalidation level.
* TPs are recalculated from avg_entry, preserving R:R multiples.
* Position is split 60/40 (weight_1/weight_2) by default.

    """Compute the DCA entry zone bounds.

    The DCA zone is defined as a fraction of the SL distance away from the
    entry price, towards the stop-loss.  By default the zone spans 30–70 % of
    the SL distance so that:

    * Entries too close to the original entry (< 30 %) are ignored — not
      enough improvement in average entry price.
    * Entries too close to the stop-loss (> 70 %) are ignored — the trade is
      near structural invalidation and DCA would be risky.

    When *regime* is provided the zone is adjusted automatically:

    * ``VOLATILE`` or ``TRENDING``: zone pushed deeper ``(0.50, 0.85)`` because
      volatile wicks will often reach 50 % drawdown before reversing.  Entering
      too early in these regimes risks a false DCA that gets stopped out.
    * ``RANGING``: tighter zone ``(0.30, 0.60)`` — ranging markets reverse more
      predictably, so waiting too deep wastes opportunity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    entry:
        Original entry price (Entry 1).
    stop_loss:
        Fixed stop-loss price.
    direction:
        Trade direction (LONG or SHORT).
    zone_range:
        ``(lower_fraction, upper_fraction)`` of the SL distance that defines
        the DCA zone.  Defaults to ``(0.30, 0.70)``.  Overridden by *regime*
        when provided.
    regime:
        Optional market regime string (case-insensitive).  Accepted values:
        ``"VOLATILE"``, ``"TRENDING"``, ``"RANGING"``.  Any other value leaves
        *zone_range* unchanged.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[float, float]
        ``(zone_lower, zone_upper)`` — absolute price bounds of the DCA zone.
        For a LONG trade, zone_lower < zone_upper < entry.
        For a SHORT trade, entry < zone_lower < zone_upper.
