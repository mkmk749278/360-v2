"""Multi-layer confidence scoring engine (0–100).

Factors:
  * SMC signal strength       (0–30)
  * Trend / EMA alignment     (0–25)
  * Liquidity quality         (0–20)
  * Spread quality            (0–10)
  * Historical data sufficiency (0–10)
  * Multi-exchange verification (0–5)
  * On-chain / whale flow     (0–10, whale-aware)
  * Order flow                (0–20)
  * AI Sentiment              (0–10, SPOT/GEM only)
  * Correlation / position lock
  * Trading-session multiplier (Asian / EU / US)

AI sentiment is active only for SPOT and GEM channels (4h/1d/1w timeframes
where 10 s of network latency is irrelevant).  SCALP and SWING channels
always receive a neutral 5.0 sentiment score so they fire with zero
external-network latency.
Macro/news AI alerts are handled separately by the MacroWatchdog.

Confidence logging
------------------
When ``CONFIDENCE_LOG_ENABLED`` is True, :func:`compute_confidence` appends a
structured JSON record to ``CONFIDENCE_LOG_PATH`` (default:
``data/confidence_log.jsonl``) for each signal scored.  The log captures all
sub-score breakdowns and can be used offline for logistic-regression analysis
to derive data-driven optimal weight profiles that replace the hand-tuned
``_CHANNEL_WEIGHT_PROFILES``.  The ``outcome`` field in each record is left
empty at scoring time and can be populated later by the performance tracker.
