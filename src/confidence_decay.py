"""Adaptive Confidence Decay.

Penalises signals that were generated from data which is becoming stale
relative to the time a human (or downstream system) would act on them.

A signal generated 60 seconds ago on the high-frequency ``360_SCALP``
channel is already borderline stale; the same signal on ``360_SWING``
is still perfectly fresh.  This module applies a channel-appropriate
linear decay factor plus a hard penalty for very old signals.

Typical usage

    ----------
    confidence:
        Raw confidence value (0–100).
    signal_generated_at:

        ``time.monotonic()`` timestamp for "now".
    channel:

        per-channel freshness window.
